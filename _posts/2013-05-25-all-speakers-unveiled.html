          Michael is a developer evangelist at Twilio, helping people embrace cloud communications.  He loves anything that can be programmed, especially things that can be connected into Lego. Prior to Twilio, Michael was consulting in the City of London - mostly building other peoples' websites. He was once involved in Telecoms R&amp;D, and has a guilt-inducing software patent around the Linux IP Stack. He is forever looking for good causes to contribute code to, and always looking to iterate and make stuff better!
